  <h1 class="animated bounceInUp">WHO I AM</h1>
    <p class="animated fadeInLeft">My name is Rob Blades. I am a Digital Humanist and I enjoy challenging myself by creating projects to apply new skills. For instance, I recently applied my knowledge of the Python programming language by developing a <a href="http://github.com/rblades/Dev-Env/blob/master/HIST5702/sonifying-dirt-data.md" target="_blank">book digitizer with my Raspberry Pi mini computer</a> that explores the sonification of visual data. I also enjoy learning digital tools and frameworks, programming, and writing. In my spare time, I enjoy mountain biking, reading science fiction, small engine mechanics, and cross-country motorcycling. This site is a portfolio for my projects, experiences, and skills.

    <p class="delay2 animated fadeInLeft">I have experience negotiating the needs of different stakeholders in project development and I have developed several digital history projects in public and academic institutions. I also served in several leadership positions to effect institutional changes. My educational background in Public History and the Digital Humanities focuses on collaborating with stakeholders on project development and implementing institutional changes. I am a highly motivated individual keen to work collaboratively in any environment. I have experience handling multiple projects simultaneously while working under pressure to meet different deadlines. I devote my time seriously to developing new skills and challenging myself.</p>
